## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT INITIATED**

### **What Was Deployed:**

1. **✅ Complete Document Marking System**
   - Enhanced TaskDetails component with marking modal
   - Missing `currentAnnotation` state added
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Retry functionality for failed document loads

2. **✅ Backend API Ready**
   - Marking endpoints: `/api/submissions/:id/marking`
   - Student viewing endpoints: `/api/submissions/:id/marked-document`
   - Database migration script included

3. **✅ Frontend Build Files**
   - React production build created and committed
   - All assets optimized for production
   - Build files now included in repository for Railway

### **Files Deployed:**
- ✅ `client/src/components/tasks/TaskDetails.js` (Enhanced with marking fixes)
- ✅ `routes/submissions.js` (Marking API endpoints)
- ✅ `client/build/*` (Production build files)
- ✅ `simple-migration.js` (Database migration script)
- ✅ Multiple deployment guides and documentation

### **Railway Deployment Process:**

1. **Build Files Committed** ✅
   - React build files now in repository
   - Railway can serve static files directly

2. **Code Changes Pushed** ✅
   - All marking system fixes deployed
   - Database migration script included

3. **Railway Auto-Deploy** 🔄
   - Railway should detect the push and redeploy
   - Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

### **Next Steps After Deployment:**

1. **✅ Verify Application Loads**
   - Check that the site is accessible
   - Confirm no build errors

2. **🔄 Run Database Migration**
   - Execute: `node simple-migration.js` on Railway
   - This adds `teacher_comments` and `annotations` columns

3. **🧪 Test Document Marking**
   - Click "Mark Document" button as teacher

- Save functionality persists to database

**For Students:**
- "View Marked Document" button appears for graded submissions
- Can see teacher comments, score, and annotations
- Read-only interface optimized for feedback review

### **Deployment Status:**
- **Code Push**: ✅ Completed
- **Build Files**: ✅ Included
- **Railway Deploy**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Database Migration**: ⏳ Pending (manual step)
- **Testing**: ⏳ Pending
