# Document Library Enhancement - Complete Implementation Summary

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### 1. ‚úÖ **In-Browser Document Viewing**
- **Feature**: Users can view documents directly in the browser without downloading
- **Supported Formats**: PDF (iframe), Images (JPG, PNG, GIF), Text files
- **Implementation**: 
  - Modal viewer with full-screen viewing capability
  - "View" button available for supported file types
  - "Open in new tab" option for external viewing
  - Fallback download option for unsupported formats

### 2. ‚úÖ **Teacher Upload Restrictions**
- **Feature**: Teachers can ONLY upload documents to their assigned grades/classes
- **Implementation**:
  - Backend validation checks teacher assignments in `teacher_assignments` table
  - Frontend shows teacher's current assignments in upload form
  - Upload blocked with error message if teacher tries to upload to unassigned class
  - Teacher assignment fetching via `/api/users/teacher-assignments` endpoint

### 3. ‚úÖ **Admin Target Audience Uploads**
- **Feature**: Admins can upload documents to specific audiences instead of grade/class
- **Target Audiences**:
  - **Everyone**: All users (students, teachers, admins)
  - **Student**: Only students can see
  - **Staff**: Only teachers and admins can see
- **Implementation**:
  - New `target_audience` column in documents table
  - Admin upload form shows audience selection instead of grade/class selection
  - Backend handles both class-specific and audience-based document distribution

### 4. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Document Access Control**
- **Feature**: Smart document visibility based on user role and document type
- **Logic**:
  - Class-specific documents (teacher uploads): Visible to assigned grade/class
  - Everyone documents (admin uploads): Visible to all users
  - Student documents (admin uploads): Visible only to students
  - Staff documents (admin uploads): Visible only to teachers/admins
- **Implementation**: Updated SQL query with OR conditions for multiple access types

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATABASE CHANGES**

### New Column: `target_audience`
```sql
ALTER TABLE documents 
ADD COLUMN target_audience VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT NULL;

-- Constraint for valid values
CHECK (target_audience IS NULL OR target_audience IN ('everyone', 'student', 'staff'))
```

### Document Access Query Logic
```sql
WHERE d.is_active = true 
  AND (
    -- Class-specific documents (teacher uploads)
    (d.grade_id = $1 AND d.class_id = $2 AND d.target_audience IS NULL)
    OR
    -- Admin audience documents
    (d.target_audience = 'everyone')
    OR
    (d.target_audience = 'student' AND user_role = 'student')
    OR
    (d.target_audience = 'staff' AND user_role IN ('teacher', 'admin', 'super_admin'))
  )
```

## üé® **FRONTEND CHANGES**

### Upload Form Differentiation
- **Teachers**: See grade/class restrictions with assignment info
- **Admins**: See target audience selection (Everyone/Student/Staff)
- **Visual Indicators**: Different colored info boxes for each role

### Document Viewing
- **View Button**: Shows for PDF, images, and text files
- **Download Button**: Always available as fallback
- **Modal Viewer**: Full-screen viewing with navigation controls
- **External Link**: Option to open in new browser tab

## üîí **SECURITY & VALIDATION**

### Backend Validation
1. **Teacher Uploads**: Mandatory assignment check against `teacher_assignments` table
2. **Admin Uploads**: Required target audience selection with valid values
3. **File Type Validation**: Allowed extensions and MIME types
4. **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum
5. **Authentication**: JWT token required for all operations

### Frontend Validation
1. **Role-based UI**: Different forms shown based on user role
2. **Assignment Display**: Teachers see their current assignments
3. **Required Field Validation**: All mandatory fields enforced
4. **File Type Restrictions**: Client-side file type filtering

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **Successfully Deployed to Railway**
- **URL**: https://web-production-6186c0.up.railway.app/documents
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with target_audience column added
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful (latest deployment)
- **Environment**: Production

### ‚úÖ **Verified Working Features**
1. **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Teacher and admin login working
2. **Authorization**: ‚úÖ Role-based access control functioning
3. **Document Queries**: ‚úÖ Both class-specific and audience-based queries working
4. **Database Migration**: ‚úÖ Target audience column exists and functional

## üìä **USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**

### For Teachers
- Clear indication of assignment restrictions

## üîß **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
