# Deployment Status & Verification Guide

## üöÄ Latest Changes Deployed

### Frontend Serving Fix (Latest Deployment)
**Issue**: Railway URL was only showing backend API JSON instead of the React frontend
**Solution**: Updated `server.js` to properly serve React frontend in production

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Reordered routes to serve React app at root URL
- ‚úÖ Added proper catch-all route for React Router
- ‚úÖ Updated CORS to allow Railway domains
- ‚úÖ Separated development and production endpoints
- ‚úÖ Added API-specific 404 handling

## üîç Deployment Verification Checklist

### 1. Backend API Verification
Visit your Railway URL + `/api/health`:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```
**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX...",
  "service": "Harmony Learning Institute API"
}
```

### 2. Frontend Loading Verification
Visit your Railway URL (root):
```
https://your-app.railway.app/
```
**Expected**: 
- ‚úÖ React app loads (Harmony Learning Institute login page)
- ‚úÖ No more JSON API response at root
- ‚úÖ Professional branding and styling visible
- ‚úÖ Login form appears

### 3. Full Application Flow Test
1. **Login Page**: Should load with Harmony branding
2. **Authentication**: Test login with any role
3. **Dashboard Navigation**: Verify student/teacher/admin panels load
4. **API Connectivity**: Forms should submit without CORS errors

### 4. Database Connectivity Check
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/api`
**Expected**: API endpoints list with database tables initialized

## üîß If Issues Persist

### Common Troubleshooting

#### 1. Still Seeing API JSON at Root?
**Cause**: Deployment hasn't completed or build failed
**Solution**: 
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify build completed successfully
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to finish

#### 2. 404 Errors on Page Refresh
**Cause**: Client-side routing not configured
**Solution**: Already fixed with catch-all route in server.js

#### 3. CORS Errors
**Cause**: Origin not allowed
**Solution**: Already updated CORS config for Railway domains

#### 4. Build Failures
**Cause**: React build issues
**Check**: 
- Railway build logs show `cd client && npm run build` success
- No permission errors (fixed with chmod in nixpacks.toml)

## üìã Environment Variables Status

### Required Variables (Auto-configured by Railway):
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- ‚úÖ `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD` - Auto-provided
- ‚úÖ `NODE_ENV=production` - Set by Railway
- ‚úÖ `PORT` - Set by Railway

### Optional Variables:
- `JWT_SECRET` - Uses auto-generated default if not set
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - For additional CORS domains

## üéØ Success Indicators

### ‚úÖ Deployment Successful When:
1. **Root URL** shows React login page (not JSON)
2. **API endpoints** work at `/api/*` routes
3. **Database** connection successful in logs
4. **No CORS errors** in browser console
5. **All dashboards** (student/teacher/admin) accessible

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Investigation When:
1. Still seeing JSON at root after 5+ minutes
2. Build errors in Railway logs
3. Database connection failures
4. 500 errors on API calls

## üìû Next Steps After Verification

1. **Test All User Flows**: Login as different roles
2. **Create Test Data**: Add sample users, classes, assignments
3. **Performance Check**: Verify loading speeds
4. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is working
5. **Custom Domain** (Optional): Set up custom domain if needed

## üîó Quick Links

- **Railway Dashboard**: Check deployment status and logs
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/wildfire20/harmony.git
- **API Health Check**: `your-railway-url/api/health`
- **Frontend App**: `your-railway-url/` (should show React app)

---

**Last Updated**: Deployment with frontend serving fix
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for verification - React app should now load at Railway URL
