## 🗃️ **Database Schema**

### Tasks Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- title, description, instructions
- due_date, max_points
- task_type ('assignment' or 'quiz')
- submission_type ('online' or 'physical')
- attachment_s3_key, attachment_s3_url, attachment_original_name
- attachment_file_size, attachment_file_type
- grade_id, class_id, created_by
- is_active, created_at, updated_at
```

### Submissions Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- task_id, student_id
- content (text response)
- s3_key, s3_url, original_file_name
- file_size, file_type
- score, max_score, feedback
- status ('submitted', 'graded', 'returned')
- submitted_at, graded_at
```

## 🔄 **Typical Workflow**

1. **Teacher Creates Assignment**
   ```
   POST /api/tasks
   - Upload attachment file → S3
   - Save task with S3 references
   - Students see new task immediately
   ```

2. **Student Submits Work**
   ```
   POST /api/submissions/assignment/:taskId
   - Upload student file → S3
   - Replace previous submission if exists
   - Delete old S3 file automatically
   ```

3. **Teacher Reviews Submissions**
   ```
   GET /api/submissions/task/:taskId
   - See all student submissions
   - Download files via S3 signed URLs
   ```

4. **Teacher Grades Work**
   ```
   PUT /api/submissions/:id/grade
   - Add score and feedback
   - Student can view results
   ```

## 💾 **File Storage**

### AWS S3 Integration
- **Bucket Structure**:
  - `task-attachments/` - Teacher-uploaded assignment files
  - `submissions/` - Student-uploaded response files
  - `documents/` - General document library files

### File Handling
- Memory-based upload processing (no local temp files)
- Automatic unique filename generation
- Metadata tracking (original name, size, type)
- Signed URL generation for secure access
- Automatic cleanup of replaced files

## 🔧 **Setup Requirements**

### Database Migration
Run the migration script to add S3 support:
```sql
-- File: migrations/add_s3_support_submissions.sql
-- Adds S3 columns to tasks and submissions tables
-- Adds necessary indexes for performance
```

### Environment Variables
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB default
```

### Dependencies Added
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - S3 client operations
