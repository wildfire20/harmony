## 📊 Storage Implementation

### Current Mode: **Local Storage (Testing)**
- Location: `./uploads/` directory
- File naming: `{timestamp}-{original-filename}`
- Access: Direct file serving via Express
- Perfect for development and testing

### Production Mode: **AWS S3 Cloud Storage**
- Bucket-based storage with unique keys
- Signed URLs for secure access
- Automatic failover to local if S3 unavailable
- Scalable and production-ready

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Local Development (Current Setup)**
```bash
# Server is already running on port 5000
npm start

# Test the system
node test-comprehensive-system.js
```

### 2. **Production Deployment with S3**

#### Step 1: AWS S3 Setup
```bash
# Create S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://your-harmony-documents

# Set up IAM user with S3 permissions
# Use the provided aws-policy.json
```

#### Step 2: Environment Configuration
```env
# Add to .env file
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-harmony-documents
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Step 3: Database Migration
```bash
# Run S3 migration
node -e "
require('dotenv').config();
const db = require('./config/database');
const fs = require('fs');
const sql = fs.readFileSync('./migrations/add_s3_support.sql', 'utf8');
db.query(sql).then(() => console.log('✅ Migration complete'));
"
```
