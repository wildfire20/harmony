# MARKED DOCUMENT UPLOAD FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ‰ FEATURE OVERVIEW

This implementation enhances the task submission workflow to support marked document uploads from teachers back to students, fulfilling the requirement:

> "Make it so that when teachers create a task the student should be able to submit a document multiple times until the due date and each document that is submitted by the student should override the previous document... After submission the teacher should be able to download the document and then mark the document after marking the teacher can upload the marked documents to each student separately so that the students can view or download their marked documents"

## âœ… IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Database Changes âœ… COMPLETE
- **Migration Script**: `add-marked-document-columns.js`
- **9 New Columns Added** to `submissions` table:
  - `marked_document_s3_key` - AWS S3 object key for cloud storage
  - `marked_document_s3_url` - Direct S3 URL for downloads
  - `marked_document_file_path` - Local file system path (fallback)
  - `marked_document_original_name` - Original filename as uploaded by teacher
  - `marked_document_file_size` - File size in bytes
  - `marked_document_uploaded_at` - Timestamp of marked document upload
  - `marked_document_uploaded_by` - Teacher ID who uploaded the marked document
  - `teacher_comments` - Text feedback from teacher
  - `annotations` - JSON array of comments/annotations on the document

### Backend API Endpoints âœ… COMPLETE
File: `routes/submissions.js`

#### 1. Upload Marked Document (Teachers Only)
```
PUT /api/submissions/:id/upload-marked-document
```
- **Authorization**: Teachers, Admins, Super Admins only
- **File Upload**: Supports multipart form data with `markedDocument` field
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (primary) with local filesystem fallback
- **Validation**: Teacher must have access to the submission's grade/class
- **Response**: Success message with file details

#### 2. View Marked Document (Students & Teachers)
```
GET /api/submissions/:id/marked-document
```
- **Authorization**: Students can view their own, Teachers can view their students'
- **Response**: Marked document details and metadata
- **Access Control**: Students restricted to their own submissions

#### 3. Download Marked Document (Students & Teachers)
```
GET /api/submissions/:id/download-marked-document
```
- **Authorization**: Students can download their own, Teachers can download their students'
- **File Delivery**: Direct S3 signed URLs or local file streaming
- **Response**: File download with proper content headers

### Frontend API Integration âœ… COMPLETE
File: `client/src/services/api.js`

Added to `submissionsAPI`:
```javascript
uploadMarkedDocument: (id, formData) => api.put(`/submissions/${id}/upload-marked-document`, formData, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
}),
downloadMarkedDocument: (id) => api.get(`/submissions/${id}/download-marked-document`, { 
  responseType: 'blob' 
}),
```

### Multiple Submission Support âœ… ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
The existing system already supports:
- **Multiple submissions**: Students can resubmit until due date
- **Override behavior**: New submissions replace previous ones
- **Version tracking**: Maintains submission history with timestamps

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### File Storage Strategy
1. **Primary**: AWS S3 Cloud Storage
   - Scalable, reliable, and secure
   - Signed URLs for secure access
   - Support for large files

2. **Fallback**: Local Filesystem
   - Automatic fallback when S3 not configured
   - Compatible with development environments

### Security Features
- **Role-based access control**: Only teachers can upload marked documents
- **Ownership validation**: Students can only access their own marked documents
- **Grade/Class restrictions**: Teachers restricted to their assigned classes
- **File type validation**: Supports common document, image, video, and audio formats
- **Size limits**: Configurable file size restrictions

### Data Integrity
- **Foreign key relationships**: Links to existing users and tasks
- **Timestamp tracking**: Full audit trail of uploads
- **JSON validation**: Structured annotations storage
- **Null handling**: Graceful handling of optional fields

## ðŸš€ WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### For Students:
1. **Submit Assignment**: Upload document (can resubmit until due date)
2. **Automatic Override**: New submissions replace previous ones
3. **View Marked Work**: Access marked documents uploaded by teacher
4. **Download Feedback**: Download marked documents with teacher comments

### For Teachers:
1. **Download Submission**: Access student submitted documents
2. **Mark Offline**: Review and annotate documents using external tools
3. **Upload Marked Document**: Upload marked version back to specific student
4. **Add Comments**: Include text feedback and structured annotations
5. **Track Progress**: View upload timestamps and student access

## ðŸ“‹ TESTING STATUS

### Database Testing âœ… PASSED
- Schema migration successful
- All new columns functional
- Data insertion and retrieval verified
- Cleanup procedures tested

### API Testing ðŸ”„ READY FOR INTEGRATION
- Backend endpoints implemented
- Frontend API methods ready
- File upload/download logic prepared
- Authentication and authorization configured

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT DEVELOPMENT STEPS

### Frontend UI Components (Pending)
1. **Teacher Interface**:
   - Marked document upload form in submission review
   - File drag-and-drop interface
   - Progress indicators for uploads
   - Success/error notifications

2. **Student Interface**:
   - Marked document download button in submission view
   - Visual indicators when marked documents available
   - Integration with existing submission status display

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Annotation viewer for marked documents
   - Comment threading for detailed feedback
   - Email notifications when marked documents uploaded

### Deployment Considerations
- Ensure AWS S3 credentials configured in production
- Test file upload limits match server configuration
- Verify SSL/HTTPS for secure file transfers
- Monitor storage usage and implement cleanup policies

## ðŸ”— FILE REFERENCES

### Modified Files:
- `routes/submissions.js` - Added marked document endpoints
- `client/src/services/api.js` - Added frontend API methods
- `add-marked-document-columns.js` - Database migration script
- `test-marked-document-upload.js` - Testing and validation

### Integration Points:
- Existing submission system (fully compatible)
- AWS S3 service (`services/s3Service.js`)
- Authentication middleware (`middleware/auth.js`)
- Database configuration (`config/database.js`)

## ðŸ“Š COMPATIBILITY

### Backward Compatibility âœ…
- Existing submissions unaffected
- All previous functionality preserved
- New columns default to NULL (no breaking changes)
- API versioning maintained

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with file API support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design considerations

---

## ðŸŽ‰ CONCLUSION

The marked document upload feature has been successfully implemented at the backend level with full database support. The system now supports the complete workflow from student submission through teacher marking and feedback delivery. Frontend integration is the next step to provide the user interface for this enhanced functionality.

**Status**: Backend Complete âœ… | Frontend UI Pending ðŸ”„ | Ready for Integration ðŸš€
