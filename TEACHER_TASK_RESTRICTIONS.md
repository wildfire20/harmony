# Teacher Task Creation Restrictions - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **Feature Implemented**

Teachers can now only create tasks for their assigned grades and classes, while admins retain full access to create tasks for any grade/class combination.

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

### **For Teachers:**
1. **Automatic Grade/Class Filtering**: Only shows grades and classes the teacher is assigned to
2. **Assignment Validation**: Validates that teachers can only select their assigned grade/class combinations
3. **Clear Visual Indicators**: Labels show "(Only your assigned grades/classes)" 
4. **Helpful Messages**: Displays assigned grades/classes at the top of the form
5. **No Assignment Warning**: If teacher has no assignments, shows warning and disables form

### **For Admins:**
- **Full Access**: Can create tasks for any grade/class combination
- **No Restrictions**: All grades and classes available in dropdowns

## ðŸ“‹ **Features Added**

### 1. **Dynamic Data Fetching**
- Fetches teacher assignments from `/api/admin/teachers/{id}/assignments`
- Only queries assignments if user is a teacher
- Uses React Query for efficient caching

### 2. **Smart Filtering**
```javascript
// Teachers only see their assigned grades/classes
if (user?.role === 'teacher' && teacherAssignments?.assignments) {
  const assignedGradeIds = [...new Set(teacherAssignments.assignments.map(a => a.grade_id))];
  const assignedClassIds = [...new Set(teacherAssignments.assignments.map(a => a.class_id))];
  
  availableGrades = grades.filter(grade => assignedGradeIds.includes(grade.id));
  availableClasses = classes.filter(cls => assignedClassIds.includes(cls.id));
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Validation**
- Client-side validation prevents invalid selections
- Server-side validation (existing backend authorization)
- Visual feedback for constraint violations

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Info Panel**: Shows teacher's assigned grades at top of form
- **Warning Panel**: Alerts if teacher has no assignments
- **Disabled State**: Form disabled if no assignments available
- **Helper Text**: Clear labels indicating restrictions

### 5. **Security Measures**
- Frontend filtering for UX (teachers can't even see unassigned options)
- Backend validation ensures teachers can't bypass restrictions
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test as Admin:**
1. Login as admin (admin@hli.com / admin123)
2. Go to Tasks â†’ Create Task
3. Should see ALL grades and classes available
4. Can create tasks for any combination

### **Test as Teacher (with assignments):**
1. Login as teacher (if any exist) or create one via admin panel
2. Assign teacher to specific grades/classes via admin panel
3. Go to Tasks â†’ Create Task
4. Should only see assigned grades/classes
5. Cannot select invalid combinations

### **Test as Teacher (no assignments):**
1. Login as teacher with no assignments
2. Go to Tasks â†’ Create Task
3. Should see warning message and disabled form
4. Cannot create any tasks

## ðŸ”— **API Dependencies**

Requires the teacher assignments endpoint:
- `GET /api/admin/teachers/{id}/assignments`
- Returns: `{ assignments: [{ grade_id, class_id, grade_name, class_name }] }`

## ðŸ“± **Visual Indicators**

1. **Blue Info Panel**: Shows assigned grades for teachers
2. **Amber Warning Panel**: Alerts about missing assignments
3. **Helper Text**: "(Only your assigned grades/classes)" in labels
4. **Disabled States**: Grayed out form when no assignments

## âœ… **Current Status**

- âœ… **Teachers Restricted**: Can only create for assigned grades/classes
- âœ… **Admins Unrestricted**: Full access maintained
- âœ… **User-Friendly**: Clear visual feedback and guidance
- âœ… **Secure**: Both frontend and backend validation
- âœ… **Deployed**: Available in production

The task creation system now properly enforces teacher assignment restrictions while maintaining a smooth user experience!
