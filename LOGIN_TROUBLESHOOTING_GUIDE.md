# 🔧 LOGIN ISSUE TROUBLESHOOTING

## Problem Identified
The login was failing because the React frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000/api` instead of the Railway production API.

## ✅ Solution Applied
**Updated API Configuration** in `client/src/services/api.js`:
- Production: Uses relative paths (`/api`) - same domain as frontend
- Development: Uses `http://localhost:5000/api`
- Added CORS credentials support
- Added error logging for debugging

## 🚀 Deployment Status
- ✅ API configuration fixed and committed
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Railway rebuilding with new configuration
- ⏳ Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

## 🔑 Login Credentials for Testing

### Super Admin (Staff Login)
- **Email**: `admin@harmonylearning.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: Super Admin
- **Panel**: Admin Dashboard with full access

### How to Test Login:
1. **Wait for deployment** to complete (2-3 minutes)
2. **Refresh your browser** to get the updated React app
3. **Select "Staff" tab** on login page
4. **Enter credentials** above
5. **Click "Sign in"**

## 🔍 If Login Still Fails:

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for error messages when clicking "Sign in"
4. Should see "API Base URL: /api" in console

### Network Tab Check:
1. Open developer tools → "Network" tab
2. Click "Sign in" button
3. Look for API call to `/api/auth/login/staff`
4. Check if it returns 200 (success) or error

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### 1. Still seeing "localhost" in API calls:
- **Cause**: Browser cached old React app
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache

#### 2. CORS errors:
- **Cause**: Cross-origin request blocked
- **Solution**: Should be fixed with relative paths and withCredentials

#### 3. 404 errors on API calls:
- **Cause**: API routes not found
- **Solution**: Check Railway deployment logs

#### 4. Database connection errors:
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL not connected
- **Solution**: Check Railway database service is running

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix:

### ✅ Login Success Flow:
1. Enter admin credentials
2. See "Welcome back, System!" toast message
3. Redirect to Admin Dashboard
4. See user menu with "System Administrator"
5. Access to all admin features

### 🔧 API Calls Should Show:
- **Base URL**: `/api` (not localhost)
- **Login endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login/staff`
- **Response**: `200 OK` with token and user data

## 🎯 Next Steps After Login Works:

1. **Test all dashboards**: Student, Teacher, Admin
2. **Create test users**: Add sample students and teachers
3. **Test functionality**: Classes, assignments, announcements
4. **Database verification**: Ensure all features work with PostgreSQL

## 📱 Mobile/Responsive Test:
- Test login on mobile devices
- Verify responsive design works
- Check touch interactions

---

**Status**: ⏳ Deployment in progress - login should work after rebuild completes
**ETA**: 2-3 minutes from last git push
**Next**: Test login with admin@harmonylearning.edu / admin123
