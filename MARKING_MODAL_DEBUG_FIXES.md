# Document Marking Modal Debug Fixes

## üîß Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing `currentAnnotation` State**
**Problem:** The marking modal was referencing `currentAnnotation` state that wasn't defined
**Fix:** Added `const [currentAnnotation, setCurrentAnnotation] = useState('')`

### 2. **Document URL Loading Issues**
**Problem:** Modal was showing blank screen because document URL wasn't being loaded properly
**Fix:** 
- Improved `openMarkingModal` function to handle errors gracefully
- Added better error handling for document URL fetching
- Modal now opens immediately with submission data, then loads document URL

### 3. **Better Error Feedback**
**Problem:** Users couldn't see what was happening when document failed to load
**Fix:**
- Added loading states and error messages
- Added retry button for failed document loads
- Added debugging information in console and UI

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
**Fix:** Added comprehensive logging to help identify issues:
- Iframe load/error events
- S3 key display in UI
- Retry functionality
- Better error messages

## üöÄ How to Test the Fixes

1. **Open Task Details page as a teacher**

4. **If document doesn't load:**
